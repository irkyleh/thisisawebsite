  <h3>A Kyle & Giles Review</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>   <h2>Welcome to Camp Arawak, enjoy the beautiful lake. The tiny tank tops and Ron's muscular arms. Just be careful there's a killer on the loose.</h2>

<div class="indent"> <p>I've heard of Sleepaway Camp, never had any interest in seeing it as it look kind of rubbish, but my friend
  Giles told me to check it out and when Giles tells you to check out a film you do it.
Sleepaway Camp tells the story of a young girls time during a summer vacation at camp Arawak,
the premise is very similar to Friday the 13th, in that a killer is on the loose and taking out
campers and adults, but there are only 3 key points in this film that caught my attention and why this is a top notch slasher film.

<p> 1. Ron - This dude has the muscular figure of an olympian. My boy Ron is Jacked baby.
  Someone who would give Vince Mcmahon a brain aneurysm if he saw him flexing and
  suplexing. A man so muscular that he has to cover himself up the higher the body
  count as to not intimidate the killer with his muscles. In the end he ends up in a
   nice sporty number. I think this was to not let the moonlight glissen of his chiseled
   body of marble in the last scene and let his face do some acting. </p>
<br />

<p>2.The Baseball Game - What do you need in the middle of a horror film?
  A five minute baseball game. With the films 85 minute run time, five minutes are spent on a baseball game.
  It does produce one of the oddest  verbal comebacks ever. ‘Eat shit and die Ricky’ then Ricky responds
  with ‘Each shit and live Bill’.  A line that I will most certainly use. I think this was added for
  the boys watching this film. To get a sense of togetherness and team bonding that you get at camps like these.
   Or they didn’t have enough footage and chuck this in.</p>
<br>
<p>3.The Ending - The ending is shocking. The look of I don’t know what on the killers face. The noise they make. The completely being butt naked. Its still a shock ending that holds up.  Its horrible and that’s it is brilliant.</p>
<br>
<div class="sleep1"><img src="ron2.png" alt="ron helping"></div>
<div class="indent"><p>The film does suffer with some dodgy acting, mainly everyone apart from Ron and his guns of steel.
   Apart from the horrifying ending, there is a part in the film which sort of leaves a bad taste in your mouth.
   It involves the camps cook and his fondness of what he likes to call ‘baldies’. Thankfully he's the first one to get it.
    This film also stars James Earl Jones dad. He doesn’t do much. The film also stars the super bitch Judy.
     A very unlikable character who also meets an untimely end with a curling shoved up somewhere you shouldn't be curling hair. </p></div>
     <br />
<p><b>Overall Sleepaway Camp is worth a watch. It may not be as scary or suspenseful as later slasher
  films and the acting and script are terrible, but for the ending it's worth it. Also Ron.</b></p>

<h1>Giles' thoughts:</h1>
<hr>
<h2>WHAT DID I JUST WATCH?</h2>
<p>Oh, Sleepaway Camp. No-no, Nightmare Vacation. Ohhh it’s
called Nightmare Vacation HERE in the UK but no one cares about us Brexiteers so
 let’s go with its original, American title, Sleepaway Camp. I watched Sleepaway
  Camp. I also made my girlfriend, Fran, watch Sleepaway Camp, and she nearly
  tapped out in the first 10 minutes because the acting was <b>that</b> bad.</p>
  <br />


  <p>I found out about this film on a Top 10 Scariest Movie Endings WatchMojo video
    (stay with me) and thought it looked pretty good in that, in that sort of
    not-very-good-acting-but-cool-gore 80s slasher flick kind of vibe. It’s all
     on YouTube in HD, which is pretty cool considering it was the number one film
     at the box office on its opening weekend.</p>

     <br />
     <p>So yeah, it opens with your average father-and-child in a boating lake
       death scene, A LAKE WHICH JUST HAPPENS TO BE NEXT TO the camp where the
       entire film is set. The tragedy. CUT TO ANGELA coming down the stairs in
       some crib with her cuz Ricky, as they’re both going to Camp Arawak, the
       camp next to the boating lake where Angela’s dad and bro were killed. What better place to send an (assumed) deeply emotionally affected child
        on holiday than the location of her father and sibling’s untimely demise?
</p><div class="aunt"><img src="aunt.png" alt="aunt"></div>
<br />
<p>Oh - Ricky’s mum, aunt Martha, is weird as balls. The actress’ Desiree Gould
  better be making a conscious decision to act like that, because otherwise,
  her natural acting style is just as scary as the Sleepaway Camp’s WatchMojo
  Top 10 Scariest Movie Endings-worthy climax. Sleepaway Camp didn’t make the
  top 10 by the way – just an honourable mention, but I’m pretty sure Insidious
  and Paranormal Activity and Drag Me To Hell (whut) did. Make of that what you will.
</p>
<br />
<p>Kyle’s already mentioned the baseball scene which happens for absolutely no reason,
 so I won’t get into that. But it really does happen for no discernible reason.
 Apart from maybe to explain that campers = good, and older, camp councillors
  = big bullying dickheads. Or something.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Oh, a bunch of murders happen to anyone who wrongs or teases Angela for being
    ‘different’ (she’s a mute, btw) But there are some kids and adults who are nice
     to her; her cuz Ricky, Ron (a camp counselor), oh, and one kid who gets her
     to talk (she stops being a mute, btw). Oh there’s also a character who, I think,
      is the most overt paedophile in motion picture history. And James Earl Jones’
       dad is in it. And his character tries to explain away the paedophile’s
       actions/comments about the campers (I think it’s something like “oh hehehe,
        he’s always like that - classic him”).</p>
  <br />
  <p>Ron is a damn fine character and gets an honourable mention for being buff
    but only 5’ 5”, and also pretty much the only nice member of staff at the
    whole establishment. Good on ya Ron. </p>

    <br />
    <p>Seriously though, the ending. It’s shocking and enjoyable to watch it
      unfold because it really makes you say <b>“… WHAT?”</b> out loud (if you’re anything
      like me AS WELL YOU MIGHT BE). You don’t really see it coming and the way
      it’s played out makes it fairly horrifying, but it’s hard to really hammer
      home the gravitas without ruining it, so I’ll stop now and let you see for yourselves.
</p>
<br />
<p><b>So yeah. Sleepaway Camp. I think it’s worth it for the end, genuinely.
  And it’s only an hour and a half long. Sure, the acting is preeeeeetty bad
  almost all of the time, but if watched ironically, it has some enjoyable moments.
   And it’s on YouTube, so you really have no excuse.</b>
